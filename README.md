# Simple Raytracer
### _Based on the **Ray Tracing in One Weekend** blog_

This is a basic raytracer I'm working on for the HackClub flavourtown event, built in C using the Raylib library.

This project is currently still in early alpha, and I haven't created releases for all platforms and architectures yet **(only Windows arm64)**, however I will release it to more platforms in the future.

## Controls

- **Camera Movement** - WASD

- **Zoom** - + / -
